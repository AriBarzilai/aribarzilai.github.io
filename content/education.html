        <h1>Education</h1>
        <h2>Computer Science at Reichman University</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                I have a mix of formal and non-formal education. I am currently in my second year of completing a B.Sc.
                in
                Computer Science at Reichman University. I have completed courses in Data structures, Algorithms, C, and
                mathematics up to Calculus II, and Linear Algebra II.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I am currently completing courses such as Operating Systems, where I am learning the intricacies of how
                computers are made and how they work, including developing compilers and assemblers. I am also taking a
                course
                in Probability, where I am learning about the mathematics behind randomness and how to use it to solve
                problems
                in computer science.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Next semester, I hope to further my understanding of Machine Learning. For this reason, I've chosen an
                elective
                in Statistics, and I will be taking a Machine Learning course.</p>

        <h2>Internship</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Between my first and second year of university, I completed a several-month internship as a
                full-stack
                developer
                (see more on my <a href="/content/employment.html">Employment page</a>). During this
                time, I learned a lot about
                mobile
                development; I learned how to use React-Native and Expo, and I sharpened my Typescript/Javascript
                skills.
                This
                later gave me the confidence to try out additional projects on my own, such as Reelscrape, which was
                developed
                in Electron.
            </p>

        <h2>Informal Education</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Although I studied a bit of computer science in highschool, the overwhelming majority of my
                knowledge
                comes from self-learning. I began with developing small WinForms applications, specifically ones
                with
                deal with file handling and data manipulation. I then moved on to developing games in a small
                open-source framework called Monogame.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although Monogame isn't recommended for game development due to its very minimalist nature, this
                actually was a great boon for learning - it meant that I had to reproduce most of the features
                myself,
                which led to an in-depth understanding of good code practices, project architecture, and game
                development. It also opened me up to a wide variety of fields, as games touch upon just about
                everything
                - graphics (including shaders, rendering, etc.), sound, physics, and more. In the past year, I've
                also
                learned Godot, and intend to learn
                Unreal Engine 5 during the summer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've also been learning about Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning in my
                free
                time. This has mostly been slow, as prior to this year I had no formal education in statistics or
                probability, and so my understanding was limited to an abstract understanding of the algorithms and
                the
                math behind them. I hope to gain a more in-depth understanding of these fields in the coming year.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also taught myself Python, for example many years ago I made a Python script which interacts with
                RSS
                and Reddit: there was a
                blog I was interested in, and whenever a new post was made, my script notified its reddit community
                by
                linking to it.
