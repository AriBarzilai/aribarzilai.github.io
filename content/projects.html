                Dragon Snake - A take on the classic game Snake. <br>
                I developed this game in Godot, as a way to learn the engine. <br>
                I was already familiar with game development, but most of my experience has been with minimalist
                frameworks
                which focus on simplicity and don't have a lot of features. <br>
                I think one of my favorite things about the transition from a framework to an engine, is the simplicity
                of
                creating UI. <br>
                In particular in Godot, I really enjoyed the concept of separating everything into "nodes", and the
                language
                GDScript is very
                enjoyable to program with; it is like a mix of Python and JavaScript. <br>

                As part of a university project, I developed a virtual computer from scratch, starting from a NAND gate.
                <br>
                The project is called "Nand2Tetris" and is based on a book by the same name. <br>
                The computer is called "Hack" and is a 16-bit computer. <br> The project is divided into two parts: the
                first
                part is building the computer's hardware, and the second part
                is building the computer's software, including developing everything needed to run that software <br>
                This involves developing a binary language the computer can understand, and then developing an assembler
                to
                convert assembly code into binary code. <br> Afterwards, I developed a virtual machine to run the binary
                code,
                and then a high-level language (called Jack) to write programs in. <br>
                The project still has some bugs I hope to fix when I have time, specifically in the latter half of the
                project -
                the virtual
                machine which runs the binary code, and the Jack compiler. <br>

                This project, called "Reelscrape", is an application which scrapes text from Instagram Reels. <br>
                The project is developed with Python and Electron, and is still a work in progress. <br>
                It also has a very interesting backstory, one which I invite you to ask me about if you ever get the
                chance.

                This is a gif of the first game I felt comfortable enough recording and sharing to the world. I made
                this
                when I
                was 16 years old in
                Monogame, an open-source offshoot of Microsoft's XNA framework, which offered a minimalist way to create
                games
                without dealing with the lower-level stuff like figuring out how to draw to the screen or load files.
                <br>
                Famous games, such as Terraria and Stardew Valley, were created with this framework. Due to its
                simplicity
                and
                as an avid fan of both
                since before they were available to the public, this was the framework I ultimately chose to first learn
                game
                development with. Engines such as Unity felt too overwhelming at the time. <br>
                In hindsight this game wasn't very good; However, I was proud of this at the time, especially
                the "screen loop" feature I made which gave the feeling of a seamless world.
                The player could loop from the top of the screen to the bottom seamlessly, giving a fun experience when
                coupled
                with the simplistic enemy AI. <br>
                Unfortunately, this game and its code is lost to time, as I didn't know about version control back then.
