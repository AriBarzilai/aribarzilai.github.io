    <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
    <div>
      Hi! Nice to meet you. I'm Ari, a Software Engineer and Tech Enthusiast.
      I'm a third-year student at Reichman University, and I'm interested in Machine Learning and Computer Vision.
      <br>
      In my free time, I love to go on runs and to develop video games.

    <h2>My Journey in Computer Science</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        I've known I would be a Computer Scientist since I was 10 years old. I've been learning about computers and
        programming since then.
        <br><br>
        I grew up watching videos of people doing crazy things with computers, and I wanted to be like them. As a
        result,
        I thought everyone at university would be super skilled.
        I started working hard and learning as much as I could about computers and programming, so that I wouldn't fall
        behind.
        <br><br>
        By the time I entered University, I realised that not everyone was like the youtubers I grew up watching,
        so I found out that I actually already had a strong foundation in computer science.
        <br><br>
        Over the past year, I've been studying ML, and I hope that by next year I'll be
        able to get a relevant research position in this field, or perhaps pursue my Master's degree.
      </p>

    <h2 id="myJourney">My Journey in Game Development</h2>
    <div>
      I've been dabbling in Game Dev for as long as I can remember.
      <br /> <br /> As a kid, I first started with a no-code tool called Stencyl, where I created a simple
      "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platformer">Platformer</a>" game. I also published an asset which
      received thousands of downloads.
      <br /> <br /> In middle school, I led a project with hundreds of members and consistent revenue, to recreate a
      popular game world in Minecraft. I also took part an an indie dev team, for a 2D sandbox game.
      <br /> <br /> In high-school, I started learning Monogame/XNA, which is when I first got serious about game dev.
      I worked on a simple space shooter, and a 2D top-down maze game. I taught myself things such as the A* algorithm,
      events and delegates, OOP and more.
      <br /> <br />
      Recently in between courses at university, I started learning Godot, a game engine that I've been wanting to
      learn.
      I developed a simple <a href="/build/dragon-snake" target="_blank">Snake game</a>, for PC and Android.
      <br /> <br />
      Although I like Godot, I've been wanting to learn 3D game development, so I'm currently learning Unreal Engine 5.
