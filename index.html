    <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
    <div>
      Hi! Nice to meet you. I'm Ari, a second year Computer Science student at <a href="https://www.runi.ac.il/en"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reichman University</a>.
      Prior to that, I was an English teacher at <a href="https://newschool.co.il/language_courses/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">NewSchool</a> as well as a hobbyist game developer.
      In the military, I was a combat soldier in the IDF.
      <br />
      In my free time, I enjoy studying and learning about Machine Learning and Computer Vision; I sincerely hope to
      contribute to the field in the future. I am currently looking for a research internship or a job which will
      give me "hands-on" experience in the field.

    <div class="clear"></div>

    <h2 id="myJourney">My Journey in Game Development</h2>
    <div>
      As computer graphics is intertwined with game development, I have a strong interest in the field and have
      a relatively in-depth understanding of the subject. I've created small-scale shaders for my games and have
      a good understanding of the rendering pipeline.
      <br />
      As a hobbyist game developer, I've worked on multiple games, although none of my original games have been
      published; games I've worked on include a 2D top-down survival shooter, a space shooter, and a
      maze roguelike. My most recent game, "Dragon Snake", is a take on the classic game Snake and is fully
      playable and downloadable on itch.io (link above). It was mostly created to learn about the Godot game engine.
      <br /><br />
      Currently, in my non-existent free time I am learning Unreal Engine 5, a well-known game engine which is used
      in the industry (not just in games! Also movies, for example). My goal is to break into 3D game development,
      and I believe that Unreal Engine 5 is the best way to do so. I also wish to gain more understanding and experience
      working with 3D models and animations, using Blender.
