    <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
    <div>
      Hi! Nice to meet you. I'm Ari, a second year Computer Science student at <a href="https://www.runi.ac.il/en"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reichman University</a>.
      Prior to that, I was an English teacher at <a href="https://newschool.co.il/language_courses/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">NewSchool</a> as well as a hobbyist game developer.
      In the military, I was a combat soldier in the IDF.
      <br />
      In my free time, I enjoy studying and learning about Machine Learning and Computer Vision; I sincerely hope to
      contribute to the field in the future. I am currently looking for a research internship or a job which will
      give me "hands-on" experience in the field.
    </div>
    <div class="clear"></div>

    <h2>My Journey in Computer Science</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        I've known I would be a Computer Scientist since I was 10 years old. I've been learning about computers and
        programming since then. Growing up, I had very skewed expectations of what it means to be a programmer, and
        assumed that all programmers are expected to constantly be in a rush to learn new concepts and technologies.
        <br>
        This is, in no small part, due to the media I consume - I grew up on Youtubers such as Fireship, or youtubers
        who did things like build an entire working computer inside of videogames such as Minecraft, and assumed that
        things like this were the norm.
        <br>
        Not wanting to be left behind, I've been learning about computers and programming for as long as I can remember.
        Eventually, I found my love specifically for Game development, and continued to learn things that were needed to
        enable this hobby. This led me down several rabbitholes such as reading CLRS as a 16 year old and implementing
        relevant algorithms, such as pathfinding algorithms, Kruskal for maze generation, etc.
        <br>
        I had this strange assumption that when I would be studying in university, things like this would be the bare
        minimum of what I would be expected to know upon beginning my studies. By the time I started University, I'd set
        my sights on "more interesting" niches, such as Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning... which I've
        recently realized is, for the most part, taught in-depth in graduate studies.
        <br>
        As a result, in the past year I've started to focus on the basics of ML, and I hope that by next year I'll be
        able to get a relevant research position in this field, to gain the necessary experience.
      </p>

    <h2 id="myJourney">My Journey in Game Development</h2>
    <div>
      As computer graphics is intertwined with game development, I have a strong interest in the field and have
      a relatively in-depth understanding of the subject. I've created small-scale shaders for my games and have
      a good understanding of the rendering pipeline.
      <br />
      As a hobbyist game developer, I've worked on multiple games, although none of my original games have been
      published; games I've worked on include a 2D top-down survival shooter, a space shooter, and a
      maze roguelike. My most recent game, "Dragon Snake", is a take on the classic game Snake and is fully
      playable and downloadable on itch.io (link above). It was mostly created to learn about the Godot game engine.
      <br /><br />
      Currently, in my non-existent free time I am learning Unreal Engine 5, a well-known game engine which is used
      in the industry (not just in games! Also movies, for example). My goal is to break into 3D game development,
      and I believe that Unreal Engine 5 is the best way to do so. I also wish to gain more understanding and experience
      working with 3D models and animations, using Blender.
